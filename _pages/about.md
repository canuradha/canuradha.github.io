I am a Graduate student pursuing my Masters at [University of British Columbia - Okanagan](https://ok.ubc.ca/). My main 
research focus is in the area of eating detection and feedback. I'm mainly interested in encouraging 
healthy eating habits through feedback provided in every stage of food intake (pre, in-situ and post). 
In addition, I'm also interested in searching for new interaction techniques for both existing and 
upcoming technologies.

I earned my Bachelors from [Unversity of Peradeniya](https://www.pdn.ac.lk/) in 2016 and had worked as a 
full-time Teaching Assistant before starting my Masters under the supervision of 
[Dr. Pourang Irani](http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~irani/).
