Flooding is a major disaster that causes millions of deaths and property damages all over the world. The main reason for this is the potential impact of sudden climate changes that leave little time for the identification and reaction to the resulting threats. A fast and accurate simulation model could be highly useful in these types of scenarios. In this study, a model is developed to simulate a flooding scenario using contour data from Sri Lanka. New model overcomes the usual limitations such as high processing power and computational costs by using Cellular Automata (CA) which governs the behavior of a particular location (i.e., a cell) in a map or a grid according to the behavior of its neighboring locations.
